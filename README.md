In this django based web app, we worked in analyzing the satellite data and imagery using machine learning algorithms and train the model to analyze the current ground situations and forecast future aspects to prevent the criticalness of sustainable factors. We used NASA's South-America data of 2019 to analyze and visualize the geo-referencing information hosted on premium AWS S3 cloud storage. It helps to mitigate any critical situations and greatly aid in our efforts to take immediate actions to sustain our planet. We're awarded Local People's choice award as the project that captured our heart.
